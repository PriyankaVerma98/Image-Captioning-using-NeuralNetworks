# Image Captioning using Neural_networks

**Aim** : 
 - To design and implement image and video caption generation deep neural network architecture.

**Set Up**
 - Python SciPy environment, ideally with Python 3.
 - Keras (2.2 or higher) is installed with the TensorFlow
 - Libraries such as scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib 
 - GPU (accessible through Google Collaboratories). Following libraries are imported to map GPU requirements
    ```python
     import​ psutil 
     import​ humanize 
     import​ os
     import​ GPUtil ​as​ GPU
     ```

This was my first hands on project in Neural Networks and was done as part of my Laboratory Project for course CS F366 at BITS Pilani.
